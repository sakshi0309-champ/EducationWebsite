            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">Education in India is primarily provided by public schools (controlled
                and funded by the government at three levels: central, state and local) and private schools. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental
                right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is
                7:5. </p>
               <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately
                75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate.[5] India's improved education system
                is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.[6] Much of the progress,
                especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public
                institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching
                a Gross Enrollment Ratio of 24% in 2013,[7] there still remains a significant distance to catch up with
                tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations,[8] a challenge that will be necessary to
                overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young
                population. </p>

                The remnants of the library of Nalanda, built in the 5th century BCE by Gupta kings. It was rebuilt
                twice after invasion, first after an invasion from the Huns in the 5th century BCE and then after an
                invasion from the Gaudas in the 7th century CE but abandoned after the third invasion by Turkic invaders
                in the 12th century. </p>
               <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall"> Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from
                possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern
                sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and
                there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in
                contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of
                education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -páli
                Language. </p>
              <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">  Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical
                education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period
                between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar)
                and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted
                a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist Páli literature, logic, páli grammar, etc.
                Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan
                Empire.

            <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the
                "10+2" pattern of education.[23]:3 In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in
                Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra),[23]:44 and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for
                college.[24] The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High
                School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.[23]:5 This pattern originated from the recommendation of
                the Education Commission of 1964–66. </p>
               <p class="sectionsubtag textsmall"> Education Policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State
                Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has
                provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional
                elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system. A significant feature of India's
                secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society.
                Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another
                feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to
                help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing.[27] A significant new feature
                has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha
                Abhiyan.
